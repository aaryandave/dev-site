## Buoy.

Navigating the complexities of autonomous maritime systems requires precise and reliable object detection capabilities. In our project for Machine Learning 2 at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), we developed an advanced buoy detection algorithm designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of autonomous watercraft operations.

### Project Overview

Our project focuses on creating a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying buoys in various aquatic environments. By leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, we trained our model to detect buoys under diverse conditions, including varying light, weather, and water surface states.

### Key Features

- **Dataset Compilation**: We curated a comprehensive dataset comprising images of buoys captured in different scenarios to ensure the model's adaptability and resilience.

- **Model Architecture**: Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our algorithm processes visual data to detect and classify buoys with high precision.

- **Performance Optimization**: Through iterative training and hyperparameter tuning, we achieved a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency, making the algorithm suitable for real-time applications.

### Applications

The successful implementation of this buoy detection algorithm holds significant potential for various applications, including:

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Enhancing the navigational capabilities of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) by providing real-time buoy detection to avoid collisions and adhere to maritime navigation rules.

- **Maritime Safety**: Assisting in monitoring and maintaining safe waterways by detecting navigational aids and potential hazards.

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Facilitating the study of marine environments by accurately identifying and tracking buoys used in scientific research.
