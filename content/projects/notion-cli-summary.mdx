## Notion CLI Summary - Automating Productivity with AI  

**The Problem:**  
Managing tasks, deadlines, and goals can quickly become overwhelming. Traditional productivity tools felt rigid and manual, often adding more friction than they removed. I wanted something smarter—something that could adapt, learn, and reduce the cognitive load of staying organized.  

**The Solution:**  
I built a CLI tool that integrates with Notion, automating task management and enhancing productivity using AI-powered features:  
- **Smart Task Summarization:** Automatically generates concise summaries of tasks using large language models (LLMs).  
- **Context-Aware Search:** Search notes and tasks in natural language for faster retrieval.  
- **Workflow Automation:** Automates recurring tasks and updates, reducing repetitive manual work.  

**Why It’s Cool:**  
This tool transforms Notion into an AI-enhanced productivity powerhouse. It’s built for anyone tired of traditional task managers and ready to level up their workflow with automation and intelligent organization.
