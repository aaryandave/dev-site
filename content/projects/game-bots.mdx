I love playing online word games—Wordle, Spelling Bee, you name it. But let’s be real: I was **horrible** compared to my friends. No matter how many fancy words I knew (thanks, Google), I couldn’t keep up. The solution? Bots.

A few weekends and many cups of coffee later, I had bots that could annihilate any word game the New York Times could throw at me. Suddenly, I was winning… __wayyy__ too much.

The result? No more friends to play with. Something about “you're such a nerd” and “stop being a *****.” Whatever. I call it __strategic automation__.
