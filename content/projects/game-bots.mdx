I love playing online word games—Wordle, Spelling Bee, you name it. But let’s be real: I **sucked**. No matter how many fancy words I knew (thanks, Google), I couldn’t keep up. My solution? Python.

A weekend and many cups of coffee later, I had bots that could annihilate any word game the New York Times could throw at me. Now, I win... _wayyy_ too much.

The result? No more friends to play with. Something about “you're such a nerd” and “stop being a *****.” Whatever, it's called __strategic automation__.
