## LTC Stocks - Time Series Prediction with Liquid Neural Networks  

![Stock Prediction Results](https://github.com/aaryandave/ltc_stocks/blob/master/results/after_training.png)

**Motivation:**  
Exploring the potential of liquid neural networks for time series prediction, specifically in forecasting stock prices. Liquid neural networks adapt their internal structure dynamically, making them well-suited for complex data like financial markets.  

**Work:**  
- Implemented a stock price prediction model using liquid neural networks.  
- Collected and processed historical stock price data for training.  
- Evaluated model performance against traditional architectures like LSTMs and GRUs.  
- Conducted experiments to test adaptability and prediction accuracy over volatile market periods.  

**Why It Matters:**  
Stock price prediction is a challenging time series problem due to market volatility. Liquid neural networks offer a promising approach by dynamically adjusting to new data, potentially outperforming static models in uncertain environments.
