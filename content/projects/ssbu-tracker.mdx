# SSBU ELO Tracker

## The Backstory:  
In my friend group, Smash Bros Ultimate isn’t just a game—it determines your respect in the friend group. Everyone’s convinced they’re the best, and every game night turns into an ego-fueled rage fest. And everyone's always got excuses on their off days. "I was distracted," "I was trying a new character," "I was just warming up," "Stick drift!" It's all __bullshit__.

**Solution?** Track every match, every win, every salty "run it back". No more “I’m definitely better, remember that one time?” excuses. Just **cold, hard stats**.

### What It Do?:  
📊 **Live Leaderboard**: Automatically updates after every match to show the current rankings. No disputes, no debates.  

🏆 **Win Streak Tracker**: Keeps tabs on who’s cooking (and who’s getting cooked).  

🔄 **Match History Logs**: Every win, loss, and “one more game”.  

🎮 **Player Profiles**: Personal records, streaks, and embarassing 3-Stocks forever immortalized.

### Why It’s Essential:  
- Tired of hearing your friends’ inflated win stories? Let the tracker shut them up.  
- Finally know who deserves bragging rights (or needs to get in the lab).  
- Adds instant stakes to every game night, since rankings are always on the line.
