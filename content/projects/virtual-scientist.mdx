Work from eLab @ Purdue University.

This repository contains research work focused on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The project explores integrating multiple data modalities to enhance the performance of generative models on scientific papers.

###### Features

- **Multimodal Embedding Integration**: Combines data from various modalities for improved context.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhances generative models with retrieved information.
