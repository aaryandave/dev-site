# Tic-Tac-Toe AI  

This project explores different AI strategies for playing Tic-Tac-Toe, demonstrating how various algorithms tackle decision-making in a simple yet strategic game. Itâ€™s a fun and educational way to see how AI "thinks" when trying to win or force a draw.

## ðŸ¤– **AI Types & Strategies**  

1. **Random AI:**  
   - **Strategy:** Makes completely random moves.  
   - **Outcome:** Plays unpredictably but lacks any real strategyâ€”fun for testing!  

2. **Rule-Based AI:**  
   - **Strategy:** Follows a basic set of if-else rules (e.g., "Take the center if available").  
   - **Outcome:** Decent against casual players but easily outsmarted by experienced opponents.  

3. **Minimax AI:**  
   - **Strategy:** Uses the minimax algorithm to simulate all possible moves and counter-moves. Always aims to maximize its chances of winning or forcing a draw.  
   - **Outcome:** Nearly unbeatableâ€”will never lose if it goes first and can force a draw if it goes second.

4. **Alpha-Beta Pruning AI:**  
   - **Strategy:** An optimized version of Minimax that skips irrelevant branches to reduce computation time.  
   - **Outcome:** Same as Minimax but much faster, making it efficient for larger game trees.
